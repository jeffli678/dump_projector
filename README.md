# dump\_projector

Allows you to extract Flash / SWF files from Windows EXE files generated with the Flash Player projector. This is a POSIX port of [nullsecurity.org's dump_projector for Windows](http://www.nullsecurity.org/article/extracting_swf_from_flash_projector), i.e. it will run on Linux and other POSIX compatible systems.

You can find binary downloads on the [project's website](http://digitalimagecorp.de/software/dump_projector/).
